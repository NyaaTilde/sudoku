Sudoku solver and generator will be made here.

It is our final project for the Artificial Intelligence course at Reykjav√≠k University.

It starts with simple backtracking search. We need to implement Forward Checking
and Constraint propagation for the solver. We would like to be able to solve
16x16 Sudoku puzzles.
