Sudoku solver and generator will be made here.

It is our final project for the Artificial Intelligence course at Reykjav√≠k University.

It starts with simple backtracking search. It has forward checking.
Constraint Propagation. Most constrained Variable heuristic, least constrained value heuristic.
We have a generator and a GUI. I'd suggest running the MAKEFILE with Xcc=-O3
