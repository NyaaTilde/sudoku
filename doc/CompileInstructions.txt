Greetings!
==========

The Sudoku program requires a Vala compiler and a C compiler.

Mininmum Version Required
-------------------------

Earlier versions may or may not work, they have not been tested nor are they
supported.

	* gcc-4.8
	* gtk+-3.14
	* libgee-0.8
	* pango-1.36.8
	* valac-0.26.1

Compiling
=========

Go to the 'src' directory and run 'make'. The Makefile provided executes the
needed commands for compilation.

Compilation errors are likely explained my missing dependencies or that their
versions are insufficient.

	$ cd src
	$ make

Running
=======

Simply execute the 'sudoku' executable.

	$ ./sudoku
